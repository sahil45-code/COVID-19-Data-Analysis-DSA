# 🦠 COVID-19 Data Analysis

## 📁 Project Overview

This project is part of the **RISE Internship - Data Science & Analytics Program** by Jamizan Skills. It focuses on analyzing and visualizing global COVID-19 data to understand the spread and severity of the pandemic, helping inform public health decisions.

## 🧠 Problem Statement

The COVID-19 pandemic created a global need for data-driven insights. This project addresses the challenge of understanding daily and cumulative trends in confirmed cases, recoveries, and deaths across different countries.

## 🎯 Objective

To analyze global COVID-19 data to visualize trends, draw comparisons between countries, and support evidence-based decision-making through graphical insights.

## 📋 Requirements

The project fulfills the following technical requirements:

- ✅ Used a dataset containing:
  - Daily confirmed cases
  - Recovered cases
  - Deaths per day
- ✅ Performed data preprocessing:
  - Cleaned and transformed datasets
  - Calculated cumulative totals
- ✅ Implemented visualizations:
  - **Line plots** for daily and cumulative cases
  - **Area charts** for comparative analysis
  - **Heatmaps** to identify geographic or temporal patterns

## 🧾 Dataset Structure

| Column Name | Description                           |
|-------------|---------------------------------------|
| Date        | Date of data record                   |
| Country     | Country/Region                        |
| Confirmed   | Cumulative confirmed COVID-19 cases   |
| Recovered   | Cumulative recovered cases            |
| Deaths      | Cumulative death count                |

## ⚙️ Technologies Used

- Python 🐍
- Pandas 🧾
- Matplotlib 📊
- Seaborn 🎨
- Plotly (Optional) 🌐
- Jupyter Notebook 📒

## 🔎 Implementation Steps

1. **Data Acquisition**
   - Loaded global COVID-19 dataset from public sources (e.g., Johns Hopkins or Kaggle)
   - Filtered data by countries of interest

2. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handled missing values and formatting issues
   - Created cumulative sum columns
   - Transformed wide-format tables into long-format where needed

3. **Visualization**
   - Line graphs to show the progression of cases over time
   - Area plots comparing confirmed, recovered, and death trends
   - Heatmaps for country-wise intensity and growth rate tracking

## 📊 Expected Outcome

- A **visual story** of the pandemic, including:
  - Global case progression
  - Country-wise comparison of recoveries and fatalities
  - Visual cues for peak periods and major trend shifts

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/covid19-data-analysis.git
   cd covid19-data-analysis

Install the required dependencies:-
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly

Launch the Jupyter Notebook:-
```bash
jupyter notebook "COVID-19 Data Analysis.ipynb"

📌 Future Enhancements:-
